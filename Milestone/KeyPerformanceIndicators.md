# Key Performance Indicators

## 1. Battery Life 
**What**
Long operation time and overall low battery requirement.

**Why**
In the areas where this application is most suitable (ie. rural/remote) frequent rechargin and matenence is not practical.  Long battery life ensures that vital signs like heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, and temperature are monitored reliably over extended periods without interruption. This is especially important for elderly or immobile patients who may not be able to manage or recharge the devices themselves.Efficient power usage also supports data muling by ensuring devices stay active and responsive when a nurse or mobile mule comes into range to collect stored data. 

**How**
This can be measured by assessing the current draw of the device aswell as overall device testing to observe the battery life.
