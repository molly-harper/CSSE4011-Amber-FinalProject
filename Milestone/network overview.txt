The system we are designing has very little bidirectional communication making this a fairly simple communication system.
The patient node periodically broadcasts its presence and waits for a response. If a mule node is within rage that node responds to the patient node. In response the patient node sends all the data is has saved. If any of the base node's known mule nodes are in range, it sends a request to whichever mule it wants to load data from and that mule node responds by sending all its data.
