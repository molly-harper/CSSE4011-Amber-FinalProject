## Project Description

## Requirements of the task
- **Requirement:**
Atleast 1 sensor other than temperature or light 

    **How we have met this requirement:**
   This requirement is met through the inclusion of heart rate, sp02 and gas sensors.

- **Requirement:**
Atleast 1 actuator

    **How we have met this requirement:**
  This requirement is met through the inclusion of a buzzer/led indicator on the stationary node that is triggered when the data indicates abnormal recordings (ie. high heart rate, low sp02)

- **Requirement:**
 Non-trivial wireless networkinf or IoT-based protocols with multiple nodes

    **How we have met this requirement:**

- **Requirement:**
Techniques/methods and non-trivial algorithms from lectures

    **How we have met this requirement**
   This requirement is implemented through the application of the kalman filter to smooth noise experienced through data collection .

- **Requirement:**
Web dashboard and/or a non-trivial visualisation of sensor data as a PC/Mobile App

    **How we have met this requirement**
