## Project Description
This project implements data muling to reduce the complication of data transmission. Patients are equiped with health monitoring devices that track vital signs such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature throughout the day. A mobile data mule, visits the stationary node with a portable device that wirelessly collects the stored data from each patient. Once the mobile node retunrs to the base node, the data is uploaded where it can be analysed to make informed healthcare decisions. This system enables continuous, low-cost health monitoring without relying on constant internet access.

## Requirements of the task
- **Requirement:**
Atleast 1 sensor other than temperature or light 

    **How we have met this requirement:**
   This requirement is met through the inclusion of heart rate and gas sensors.

- **Requirement:**
Atleast 1 actuator

    **How we have met this requirement:**
  This requirement is met through the inclusion of a buzzer/led indicator on the stationary node that is triggered when the data indicates abnormal recordings (ie. high heart rate, low sp02)

- **Requirement:**
 Non-trivial wireless networkinf or IoT-based protocols with multiple nodes

    **How we have met this requirement:**

- **Requirement:**
Techniques/methods and non-trivial algorithms from lectures

    **How we have met this requirement**
   This requirement is implemented through the application of the kalman filter to smooth noise experienced through data collection .

- **Requirement:**
Web dashboard and/or a non-trivial visualisation of sensor data as a PC/Mobile App

    **How we have met this requirement**
